A Queue is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. This implementation uses a fixed-size array.

- `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `display()`: Prints all elements in the queue.

## ðŸ§± Queue (Linked List Implementation)

A Queue is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. This implementation uses a singly linked list.

## ðŸ”— Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure where each node contains a data field and two pointers, `prev` and `next`. The `prev` pointer points to the previous node, and the `next` pointer points to the next node in the sequence.

- `displayBackward()`: Prints all elements in the list from tail to head.

## ðŸ”„ Circular Linked List

A Circular Linked List is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. There is no `NULL` at the end.

# day3

This repository continues with C++ implementations of tree-based data structures and algorithms, including:

- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Tree traversal algorithms (inorder, preorder, postorder)

- [Binary Search Tree](#binary-search-tree)
- [Tree Traversal Algorithms](#tree-traversal-algorithms)

## ðŸŒ³ Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Unlike a Binary Search Tree, there are no ordering constraints on the values of the nodes.

### ðŸ“‚ Implementation

- `Tree.h`: Contains the class definition for `BinaryTree` and `Node`.
- `Tree.cpp`: Contains the implementation of `BinaryTree` methods.

### ðŸš€ Features

- `insert(data)`: Inserts a new node into the binary tree. (Note: This implementation inserts in a way that resembles a BST for simplicity, but a general binary tree can have arbitrary insertion logic).
- `remove(data)`: Removes a node with the specified data from the tree.
- `search(data)`: Searches for a node with the given data and returns `true` if found.

## ðŸŒ² Binary Search Tree (BST)

A binary search tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to any value in its left subtree and less than or equal to any value in its right subtree. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

### ðŸ“‚ Implementation

- `Tree.h`: Contains the class definition for `BinarySearchTree` and `BSTNode`.
- `Tree.cpp`: Contains the implementation of `BinarySearchTree` methods.

### ðŸš€ Features

- `insert(data)`: Inserts a new node into the BST while maintaining the BST properties.
- `remove(data)`: Removes a node with the specified data from the BST while maintaining its properties.
- `search(data)`: Searches for a node with the given data efficiently, leveraging the BST properties.

## ðŸš¶ Tree Traversal Algorithms

Tree traversal algorithms are methods for visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once. This project implements the three common depth-first traversals:

### ðŸ“‚ Implementation

- `Tree.h`: Declares the traversal methods for both `BinaryTree` and `BinarySearchTree`.
- `Tree.cpp`: Implements the recursive helper functions for each traversal.

### ðŸš€ Features

- `inorderTraversal(visit)`: Visits nodes in the order: left subtree -> root -> right subtree. For a BST, this results in visiting nodes in ascending order of their values.
- `preorderTraversal(visit)`: Visits nodes in the order: root -> left subtree -> right subtree. Useful for creating a prefix expression of the tree.
- `postorderTraversal(visit)`: Visits nodes in the order: left subtree -> right subtree -> root. Useful for deleting the tree or generating a postfix expression.

### Usage Example (main.cpp)

To test both Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree implementations along with their traversal algorithms, you can use the `main.cpp` file provided previously. It demonstrates insertion, search, removal, and all three traversal methods for both tree types.
